# NPRG036-T2G4 Specification

## Overview

A library has a catalog of book copies available for lease. 
Each book copy is identified in the library system by its SKU identifier and is available in the library system for a specific amount of time. 
If the lease availability expires, a book copy is discontinued or offered under a different SKU with a new expiration date. 
Library users can search each offered book copy by the book information, such as ISBN, author name, or genre and language categories.
